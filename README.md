## Brief Description
A Web Application for **Image Processing** using python. The application merge between two images after resizing them and using gray scale .


## Demos
1. Merging mag of 1st image + phase of 2nd image

2. Merging mag of 2nd image + phase of 1st image

3. Uniform Magnitude

4. Uniform Phase

## Features
> 1. Merging two images using phase of first image + magnitude of second image and vice versa. 
> 2. There are also two options(Uniform Magnitude or Uniform Phase). 
> 3. You can also check **High Pass Filter** -if you want- by changing (if condition) by this line{ if (WIDTH >= self.    Boundaries[1][0] and WIDTH <= self.Boundaries[1][1]) and (HEIGHT > self.Boundaries[0][0] and HEIGHT <= self.Boundaries[0][1]): }
  1. (high pass filter)Merging mag of 1st image + phase of 2nd image
